    Game Overview:

    "The Bank Heist - Cards Edition" is a hybrid stealth-action and strategic card-based HTML5 game played on a dynamic 80x80 grid. 
    Players must successfully complete a high-stakes bank heist by combining precise stealth movement with the tactical usage of special action cards—DASH, STEALTH, and DISABLE—to outsmart patrolling guards and bypass security. The game should be placed within the game canvas, shouldn't overflow and should be mobile friendly. SO adjust the size accordingly and responsively.

    Core Game Elements:

        Grid-Based Layout:
        - The game is played on a detailed 80x80 grid representing the bank floor.
        - Some cells are walls or obstacles where the player and guards cannot move.
        - Vault and Exit cells are marked distinctly on the grid.
        - Gridlines are subtly visible to help players visualize movement.
        - Randomized walls and map layouts across different runs for replayability.

        Player Character:
        - A top-down view stealth agent.
        - Movement: Controlled via Arrow keys/WASD (desktop) or swipe gestures (mobile).
        - Speed: Base movement speed of 1 unit; doubles with the DASH card.
        - Powers: DASH, STEALTH, and DISABLE, each activated through cards.
        - Objective: Navigate, retrieve the Vault Key, and reach the Exit undetected.

        Guards (AI Enemies):
        - Patrol predefined routes, moving door-to-door inside the bank.
        - Detection Radius: 40px circular area around each guard.
        - Patrol Behavior: Move along doorways, pause briefly, reverse routes dynamically.
        - Guard States:
            - Normal: Patrols and detects the player.
            - Frozen: Disabled temporarily when DISABLE card is used.
            - Blind: Cannot detect the player during STEALTH activation.

        Special Cards (Power Cards):
        - Each card is a consumable special power with a limited duration (10 seconds). Show the timer also.
        - DASH:
            - Doubles the player’s movement speed. 2 steps at a time in the direction selected after clicking on dash card
            - Best used for quick dashes across open spaces.
        - STEALTH:
            - Makes the player invisible to guards.
            - Allows movement even through detection zones.
        - DISABLE:
            - Freezes all guards in place.
            - Best used to bypass tight guard patrols.
        - Card Usage Mechanics:
            - Players have a hand of 3 cards visible at all times.
            - Clicking/tapping a card activates the corresponding power.
            - Used cards are immediately replaced by drawing from the deck.
            - Deck size is initially 10 cards, randomly generated at game start.
